## Summary of Insights

I examined the effectiveness of 57 campaigns by calculating and comparing metrics such as customer conversion rates and click through rates. I looked at overall cost, cost of acquiring a customer, and cost of acquiring an impression. What I found is that CAM005 had the lowest customer acquisition rates and lowest click-through-rates while it also had one of the highest customer acquisitions costs and is among more expensive campaigns for overall cost. For this reason I recommend to suspend this campaign. CAM018 had the highest success rate for customer acquisition with a 3.72% customer conversion rate while also having one of the cheapest costs per customer. CAM055 had the highest success rate for brand awareness with a click-through-rate of 65.74%.

-Used SQL to pull the data I needed for analysis, build tables, and calculate metrics such as number of sign ups per campaign, customer acquisition rates, and click-through-rates. 
-Used Excel to create pivot tables with conditional formatting in order to visualize seasonality and highlight cost differences
-Used Excel to present my findings and provide process documentation
