## Summary of Insights
For this project I analyzed 20,000 rows of transactional data in order to find top customers and the distribution of customers based on RFM (Recency Frequency Monetary) scores. I found that the top customers fell in the following groups: 40-49 years old, mass customers, female, from New South Whales, and from the "manufacturing" job industry. I also found that 57.86% customers fell into the 2nd and 3rd quartiles for recency. Such customers are a potential flight risk but haven't been lost yet. The recommendation is to look into why they these customers haven't bought in a while and likely target them with campaigns and incentives. 

- Used Excel to clean, mitigate, and prepare data for analysis
- Used Excel to calculate RFM scores and create pivot tables and charts 
- Used Tableau to create a dashboard displaying most important metrics

## Context
For this project KPMG provided three tables with data from a hypothetical company selling bikes and accessible cycling accessories, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd:
- Transaction history: 20,000 rows of transactions
- Customer demographics: 4,001 customers
- Customer address: 4,000 customers
  
The project was broken down into three tasks:
1. Assess, clean, and mitigate the data. 
2. Explore the data and create a power point [presentation](https://github.com/agiliariniosm/Alice_Giliarini_Portfolio/blob/main/kpmg/KPMG%20virtual%20experience%20program.pdf) with your insights. 
3. Create a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alice.giliarini/viz/KPMG_16465478819120/Dashboard1#1) to present to the client.
